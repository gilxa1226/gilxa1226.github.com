        <h4 id="monday">Monday</h4>
        <p>Mondays are relatively calm for Squad Haller, the day starts off bright and early at 0500, we get ready then get Ben prepped for the day, 
            then it's off to work and school. After work and school it's one fo the "quiet" nights, so I generally get a run in, then we do some sort of 
            family activity. Bed time rituals start at 1955 for Ben.</p>
        <h4 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h4>
        <p><img class="img-right img-tiger" src="images\tiger.jpg" />Tuesday starts just like Monday, and doesn't deviate until after school and work. For three Tuesdays in a month: the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 4th, we have
            our Cub Scout Den 5 meetings for 1 hour. This hour is spent doing activities and helping a den of 9 1st grade boys earn belt loops in order
            acheive the Cub Scout Tiger Rank. After this we get home and it's time for reading homework, then the normal bed time rituals.</p>
        <h4 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h4>
        <p>Wednesday is pretty much identical to Monday, with an occasional night out for either my wife or I with our friends. Every 3<sup>rd</sup>
            Wednesday we have a Cub Scout Pack meeting, and with a pack of close to 100 1<sup>st</sup> through 5<sup>th</sup> graders it probably
            borders on organized chaos.</p>
        <h4 id="thursday">Thursday</h4>
        <p><img class="img-left img-water-pump" src="images\water-pump.jpg" />Thursday follows the normal routine. After work and school, Ben and I have Lego League, where he and his team have been using a Lego Robotic kit
            to follow this years Aqua Adventure theme. As part of the program the team has to put together a "Show-Me" model using the theme kit, which is 
            a model of a water pump found commonly in Africa, and the Robotics set to solve some problem. The fun part about this is the team gets to see 
            a whole engineering procces, including failing, and having to redesign. Case in point, they wanted to use the color change sensor to find 'dirty'
            water (dark colored Legos) so they could trigger the pump to redirect the water to holding area to be cleaned. Unfortunately they found out the
            color change senor picked up on every change, and would change the water direction every time a new brick came out of the pump. So they pivoted
            and built/added an Earthquake sensor to trigger the pump to stop if an earthquake was detected, so hopefully protect the pump and the water supply.
            When we get home from Lego League, it's time for writing homework, then off to bed.
        </p>
        <h4 id="friday">Friday</h4>
        <p>Friday - gateway to the weekend, and exactly like Monday. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Friday of every month is Parent's Night Out at Ben's day care. That 
            generally means the Wife and I get a date night. Bed time gets postponed 1 hour on the weekends, in the hopes that Ben sleeps in a bit...</p>
        <h4 id="saturday">Saturday</h4>
        <p><img class="img-right img-osu" src="images\osu.png" />Saturday starts off with Ben sleeping in, this means he wakes up at 0630 instead of 0600. Saturday is generally the fun day of the weekend, we do 
            a few chores around the house, but mostly Saturday is spent doing some sort of activity, either with the Scouts, or as a family. During college 
            football season you will find a game on somewhere, always the Buckeyes if they are on, otherwise whatever is deemed the best game. We also tend 
            to have a family dinner on Saturdays with my parents.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sunday">Sunday</h4>
        <p><img class="img-left img-browns" src="images\browns.png" />Sunday starts off at the same time, 0630, with Ben waking us up to tell us he's going to go downstairs and watch T.V. or play. Sunday is chore day,
            we do our grocery shopping, laundry. During football season Grandpa Fred comes over to help me cheer/yell at the Cleveland Browns. Ben has swimming
            lessons. It's otherwise a faily relaxed day, especially if Saturday was crazy.
